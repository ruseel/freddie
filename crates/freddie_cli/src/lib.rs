//! The verbs that manage one daemon: finding it, starting it, stopping it, and following its log.
//!
//! A program built on this holds something there can only be one of, and gets `start`, `restart`,
//! `status`, `logs`, `stop`, and a hidden `daemon` for free, each keyed to the daemon the command
//! line named. Nothing here looks inside the process: the verbs read a lock file, spawn a binary,
//! signal a pid, and tail a log, and every one of those works the same whatever the daemon is for.
//!
//! An app declares its own [`clap::Parser`] and flattens [`Verb`] into it, so the binary's name,
//! its about line, and any verbs of its own are the app's to write.
