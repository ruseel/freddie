//! Mercury's runnable v1: grab the keyboard and drive the model.
//!
//! `freddie_keyboard::intercept` swallows every key and hands each to the model.
//! Two loops over two channels: the event loop dispatches (mutating state,
//! producing effects); the effect loop performs them, re-emitting keys through the
//! `Emitter` and foregrounding apps through `freddie_app_nav`. A
//! `freddie_app_nav` watcher runs the app-navigation source: it reports the
//! frontmost app as a `Foreground` event, so foregrounding an app (the effect) and
//! observing it come up (the event) are decoupled the way the model expects.
//!
//! Every key goes through the model, so `escape` is handled there (it goes home)
//! and `q` from home quits. The menu bar's Quit is a second way out, one that does
//! not depend on the grabbed keyboard still working.
//!
//! Quitting is a `Kill` effect, which ends the effect loop rather than exiting the
//! process, so the way out runs destructors: the keyboard is released and main's
//! run loop is stopped.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! Three, each asleep in its own loop, joined only by a channel.
//!
//! The main thread runs the platform run loop and nothing else, so that `AppKit`
//! can deliver callbacks there. It is a doorman: a callback sends into the event
//! channel and returns. Main-thread callbacks are serialized, so a slow one would
//! stall every other source.
//!
//! The tap thread, spawned inside `freddie_keyboard::intercept`, runs its own run
//! loop for the `CGEventTap`. It has always been off main, which is why the
//! keyboard works whatever main is doing.
//!
//! The worker thread runs the tokio runtime, owns the state and the `Emitter`, and runs both
//! the event and effect loops. It is the only place state is mutated, so there is no shared
//! mutable state and no `Mutex`, and it is the only consumer of the effect channel, so effects
//! are performed in the order dispatch produced them: a modifier reaches the OS before the key
//! carrying its flag.
//!
//! On macOS this needs Accessibility (and Input Monitoring). `cargo run -p mercury`
